          Hi! My name is Maciej PÄ™dzich, but you can call me
          <strong>Mac</strong>. I started PreVue Land, because I'd been looking
          for websites showcasing <strong>community</strong> Vue/Nuxt
          components, plugins, modules, etc. <em>in action</em>. Or in other
          words, their potential use-cases in actual applications. But as you've
          probably guessed by now - <strong>I'd failed</strong> to find any
          sites that matched the criteria.
        </p>
        <p>
          PreVue Land aims to fill the void I've just described, but also to go
          an <strong>extra step further</strong>. Each month, one of these demos
          will be <strong>written up</strong> in an article about its
          development process, including a
          <strong>full specification</strong> of every feature as well as a
          <strong>detailed walkthrough</strong> of the implementation.
        </p>
        <p>
          Lastly, each article is <strong>available on Hashnode</strong> too,
          meaning you <strong>don't</strong> have to worry about losing access
          to any article should this website become unavailable for whatever
          reason. So what are you waiting for? <strong>Go ahead</strong> and
          check out some of the latest demos or articles down below!
